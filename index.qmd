We develop and apply new demographic methods. We are the authors of the book [Bayesian Demographic Estimation and Forecasting](https://www.routledge.com/Bayesian-Demographic-Estimation-and-Forecasting/Bryant-Zhang/p/book/9780367571368), and the developers of the R package [bage](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bage).

Our methods work with

- noisy data, 
- small populations, and
- multiple data sources.

We help organizations with

- building analysis pipelines, and
- one-off analyses.

Current projects include

- redesigning the UK population estimation system,
- estimating historical Māori populations, and
- measuring life expectancy for First Nations Australians.
